Robin Hood Hack-a-thon App - 

The official app for with it hits the fan in New York City. We are providing people 
with a resource for semi-emergencies. Think: You need shelter because your house burned down or food but cannot afford to buy it on your own or maybe you need money to pay your bills because this months check won't cut it or you're feeling sad because someone is missing. During these times we usually don't know where to go for help, a lot of people aren't even aware that there is help out there. This application allows you to connect with those you love most, alerting them that something is not okay, while simultaneously being proactive and searching for places near you that can provide you with the help you need. No need to panic or look helplessly through the yellow pages. We will give you the organization's address, phone number, e-mail address(if applicable), directions on how to get there and buttons that link you directlyto what you, the user, needs!
