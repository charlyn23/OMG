That’s even faster than calling your mom. That’s the kind of efficiency you deserve in a time of personal crisis. 


Think: You need shelter because your house burned down or food but cannot afford to buy it on your own or maybe you need money to pay your bills because this month's check won't cut it or you're feeling sad because someone is missing. During these times we usually don't know where to go for help, and many of us are unaware that there is help out there.

  OMG allows you to connect with those you love most: 
  - Alert them that something is not okay instantly with prepared text templates that OMG sends on your command to your saved emergency contacts
  
  OMG connects you to the resources you need:
  - Be proactive. OMG finds places near you that can provide you with precisely the help you need. No need to panic. OMG provides the organizations' address, phone number, e-mail address(if applicable), directions on how to get there and buttons that link you directly to what you, the user, needs!
  
  OMG connects you to the appropiate emergency authorities
